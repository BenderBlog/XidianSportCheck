# XidianSportCheck

像蛇一样，检出你在西电的体育相关信息。( python 是蟒蛇不知道啊 )  
根据 hawa130 的 javascript 版本重写。

Check your sport information in Xidian University, like snake.  
(Because it is written in python.)  
A rewrite of hawa130's script, which written in javascript.

## How to use?


1. 获取这两个 python 库：<br>
Get these extra python library:
```
python-requests # Since we're going to send data to Internet.
python-cryptography # Some elements in headers need this.
```

2. 获取这两个脚本，放在同一目录下。主要脚本的最后一行写入你的学号和密码。<br>
Get the two scripts. Place them in the same folder. Change the last line in the main script, fill your school ID and password there.

3. 给老子运行！<br>
Run it!

## More function?
我很懒，不打算给大家输出具体记录了。电表有个获取期末成绩功能，我有点迟疑要不要弄，因为未开放查询。<br>
我才刚开始写三天 python 好嘛，之前我一句话都没写过的:-P  
I am too lazy to output the detailed record. I am wondering about the Final Score, since I cannot see it.<br>
Come on! I have just started writing python for about... three days:-P
